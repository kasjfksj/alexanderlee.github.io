# 8.28 blog

I finally finished the encoding part, which was quite annoying. The previous method only deals with a single stream of byte array. I, however, have to deal with a different images with each image having different byte length. It was quite confusing to design train dataset at first, but then I just did some coding, some drawing, and designed my own training batches generator. For most of the time, it was just purely pattern matching. For instance, the model used in the paper only takes train batch. So, I configure the GPT to receive it only.
