I would say that my first year experience in UCI is mediocre. There are many things that I regretted. 

One of my regrets is not successfully changing my major to Computer Science. I found it incredibly frustrating that every time I tried to enroll in ICS 31, the website would crash. Meanwhile, my roommate consistently registered for the ICS series, which only made me more exasperating. I later learned that UCI has a policy guaranteeing enrollment in ICS 31 if you have successfully completed ICS 9. I wasn't aware of this policy until I spoke with some alumni about changing majors. If I had known, I could have applied for both ICS 9 and ICS 31 simultaneously instead of focusing on just one class. Understanding university policies is crucial, but this particular policy was not clearly shown on the website, nor was it mentioned by my academic advisor. When I inquired about easier ways to switch to the ICS major, I was only advised to take summer classes at a community college. I initially looked for local community college courses but later discovered through alumni that a course at UCB could substitute for ICS 31-33. I successfully enrolled in that course. During the summer, I worked hard on the course and earned an A+, which was a great achievement. However, my excitement was quickly dampened when the ICS department informed me that the course could only replace ICS 31-32, not ICS 33 as I had hoped. They explained that the contract for course replacement had expired last year, so it could no longer cover ICS 33. This was particularly frustrating since the syllabus for ICS 33 closely matched that of UCB's 61A, both covering similar topics such as generators, iterators, and recursion. What added to my frustration was that I couldn’t immediately replace the UCB course to ICS 31-32; this could only be done after the major restriction was lifted on September 19th. I was well aware of my difficulties with course enrollment. Despite this, I realized that I could still switch my major to Data Science, which is also under the ICS department, even if I couldn’t enroll in ICS 33. Overall, the process of changing my major was quite stressful and did not turn out as I had hoped.

Second regret is that I didn’t make many friends. Initially, I joined clubs like AI and ACM with the hope of meeting new people. I attended events such as the beach party organized by the AI club, but I found it difficult to engage in conversations due to a lack of relevant experiences to share. This led to a situation where I felt disconnected from others who talked about their friends and experiences in other clubs. As a result, I stopped attending these events because I felt alienated. Reflecting on the club event I attended before, like the beach party, I realize that instead of avoiding club activities, I should have attended more events and taken note of any experiences or topics that I could discuss later. Building relationships often depends on having a wealth of experiences to share, and my difficulty in forming connections was partly due to my limited engagement. In hindsight, participating more actively would have provided me with more stories and content to share, ultimately leading to better relationships.
