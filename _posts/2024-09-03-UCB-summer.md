This summer, I took UC Berkeley’s CS 61A course which was hard as the rumor said, but my journey included more than just academic challenges. It began with a housing issue. I had arranged to stay in a UCB student house, but just before my arrival, the landlord cut my stay short to July 31 instead of August 15, which meant I had to move out before even finishing my course. Moreover, I was worried it might be a scam, so I quickly canceled and had to scramble for new accommodation.

With no place to stay, I had to stay in hotel for 6 days, with sales at $99 a night. It was really expensive. I tried to search for a cheaper option. Fortunately, another CS 61A student, W, offered me a room. To my surprise, he was also a UC Berkeley student, which was a huge benefit since he could give me insights into campus life, dining spots, and local tips.

As I began my summer course in UC Berkeley’s CS 61A, I felt confident. The early lectures covered basic Python concepts like booleans, while loops, and functions—topics I knew well. The homework and projects were manageable, and I finished them early. I was optimistic about getting an A+.

During this time, I explored the campus with W. It was vast and impressive, almost like a small town with magnificient buildings. Since the campus is on a slope, walking around was tiring. I asked W why the university was built on a hill. Why wouldn't they build on plains? He shrugged and said when people constructed the campus, this hill was probably the only available place for them to build. We also visited some iconic buildings and sculptures donated by alumni decades ago. This whole place is magnificent and historical, which was really amazing. We also checked out local restaurants, dessert store, and stores like Target and Safeway. 

Everyday, I would get up, shortly prepare breakfast and get dressed, and take No. 88 or 36 bus with W . Before the lecture, I'd visit a small café in the underground area run by a friendly old lady. I would usually order chocolate chip cookies or muffins as snacks during class. Because I went there so often, that lady reckonized me and would prepare the snacks before I even ordered. It was really kind and considerate of her, remembering me and my preference. 

After the one and a half hours of lecture, we would head downhill to the Subway, where I would get the BEAST. Although it was really salty, probably from the chess, I really liked the mix of sausage, beef, lettuce. It was relatively cheap compared with others. The crunchiness of lettuce and bread, softness of meat and cheese, the meaty flavor and freshness from vegetables all entangled in my mouse, creating a symphony of taste. 

After that, we would go to the lab or discussion, depending on the day. In fact, there were no real discussions. Most lab and discussion were just about doing homework and projects, which I could easily get bored when I finished my work. After this period finished, it was in the mid afternoon, where we often had relaxation nearby. I would go to the gelato store near campus, and my favorite flavor is tiramisu or, if the store didn't provide the flavor, coffee. I would just sit outside, eating the dense and rich-flavored ice cream, and watching cars and crowds pass by. Sometimes, we would go to the gym to exercise. W was more into developing his muscle while I just want to keep myself fit, so the climbing and running machine would be my favorite. The above was perhaps the summary of daily life.

During my stay with him, W shared his experience with UC Berkeley. He said to me that he majored in History and Political economy, which startled me very much. I had no idea why he would take computer science when history and politics had nothing to do with STEM. He first told me in a tone like an old professor, saying that every fields were related to each other, even though the combination would seem ridulous, but still existed. Of course, he then said, the reason is to learn new skills, especially when social science required data collection and processing. The programming skill would potentially help him get a job. However, UCB was such a top-notch in STEM and its STEM courses, from W's articulation, were horrendously hard. He had taken CS 61A for 2 times but had to drop from it because he did so bad that it could greatly affect his GPA. I told him I had a really good foundation on Python. He seemed greatly relieved. I was skeptical about his statement at first. Sure, UCB course was challenging, but how hard could CS 61A, an intro course, be?

As the course continued, I began to see what W meant about its difficulty. Topics like iterators and generators were completely new to me, and I needed to watch videos to understand them. The sample exams was the most daunting; even with the answers, some questions were confusing. I realized this course was very tough and that I needed to be very careful to get an A. I started preparing for the midterm two weeks in advance, working on exam questions and reviewing all my notes. I began attending tutoring sessions to augment my understanding. The stress increased, and there was even a period that I questioned if computer science was right for me. I might as well just quit the course, I thought, perhaps only UCI courses fit me.

Fortunately, I had excellent TAs, tutors, and lecturers. They answered my questions patiently and their encouragement helped me cope with the stress. One tutor inspired me the most. He was a sophomore who had never programmed before taking CS 61A. He practiced past exams multiple times and got his exam score from 50 to 60 and then finally to 90. His hard work motivated me and I believed that I needed to have the same dedication as him and I kept more practicing. Even W was amazed by my dedication when he asked me why I studied hard for this course even though I had relatively good foundation on programming. I told him I wanted to get A+ on this course and also told him about the adamant spirit of that tutor, and he was also inspired to study past exam together with me.

Midterm day finally arrived, and I felt restless as soon as I woke up. The exam was scheduled from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m., so I had plenty of time to review. Despite this, I struggled to focus during my practice exams because I was so anxious about the real test. I told W that I would head to school early and walk around. To calm my nerves, I had some Italian spaghetti for lunch and gelato for dessert. I spent most of the time sitting on the grass land, enjoying the warm breeze and cool grass.

As the exam time approached, I went to the assigned classroom. The exam started at 7:03 p.m. I felt prepared for the first question because I had done well on first questions in past exam. But when I flipped the page, my heart nearly stopped. Instead of the expected high-order functions or environment diagrams, the first question was about generators and iterators—topics I had just recently learned. The next page had a question about list operations, another difficult topic for me. I panicked for a few minutes at first, trying to figure out the answers, but then I decided to move on to questions I was more confident about. Most questions were fine, and I could understand all the recursion questions. After finishing those, I went back to previous questions, struggling to remember everything about iterators, generators, and list operations. I spent an hour on those two questions but was still unsure about my answers after the exam ended. I felt devastated by the difficulty and told W, "It’s over. I don’t think I’ll get an A. I might just aim for a B."

Just two days later, W told me our exam scores were out. I hesitated to check, fearing a low score. When I finally opened the email, I was shocked to see that I had scored 61.5 out of 64. At first, I thought it might be a mistake since I did poorly on the first two questions. However, I learned that the average score was only 35.69, and I had previously scored 47.5. I was amazed by my result and felt pretty confident about the final exam, knowing that the class's overall performance was low and the TAs would likely give us a curve.

After finishing final exam, stepping out of the classroom into the crisp evening air at 10 p.m., I felt a deep sense of achievement from completing the challenging course. Yet, a few days before I left, a wave of sadness hit me. I had to say goodbye to everything I had enjoyed: the campus, the course, the TAs, the Italian restaurants, the gelato store, Safeway, and the buses. It had been a tough but incredible experience, unlike anything I had encountered at UCI, and I would defintely keep it in my memory. 

After I arrived in Irvine for a few days, I received a letter saying I got an A+ on this course. I smiled and knew I achieved my goal.
