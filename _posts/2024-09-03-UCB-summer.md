This summer, I took UC Berkeley's challenging CS 61A course, but the journey extended beyond the academic dilemma. It started with the housing problem. Initially, I arranged to stay in a UCB student house, but just before my arrival, she unexpectedly shortened my stay to July 31 instead of August 15. Fearing a potential scam, I quickly canceled the arrangement and faced the stress of finding new accommodation.

With hotel costs at $99 a night, I frantically searched for a more affordable option. My luck changed when another CS 61A student W offered me a room. To my surprise, he was also a UC Berkeley student. This is very fortunate for me, because he could provide valuable insights into campus life, dining spots, and local tips.

As I began my summer course in UC Berkeley’s CS 61A, my confidence was high. The initial lectures covered fundamental Python concepts like booleans, while loops, and functions—material I was very familiar with. The homework and projects were straightforward, and I completed them ahead of schedule. With this early success, I was optimistic about securing an A+.

During this time, I explored around the campus with W. We visited restaurants, dessert shops, and stores like Target and Safeway. W shared his experience about UC Berkeley which is the top in STEM fields. He mentioned that he had attempted CS 61A twice before giving up due to its difficulty. I was skeptical at first. Sure, CS 61A was challenging, but it wasn't that hard, right?

However, as the course progressed, I gradually understood what W said about the difficulty of this course. Topics like iterators and generators were completely new to me, and I had to search videos to fully understand them. The new knowledge was not the most daunting thing to me. The sample exam was intimidating; even with the answers, some questions were beyond my comprehension. I finally realized that this course was very challenging, and I needed to be very cautious to get an A. Thus, I started to prepare for midterm 2 weeks before, doing exam questions and reviewing all the notes I took. I began attending tutoring sessions to clarify my understanding and tackle the midterm exercises. The stress began to increment, and there was a time of me questioning whether I was fitted to study computer science.
