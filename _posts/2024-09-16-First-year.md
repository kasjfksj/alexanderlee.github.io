I would say that my first year experience in UCI is somewhat successful and I achieved something.

Firstly, I participated in an AI Innovation Challenge last year, which gave me the chance to collaborate with other students passionate about AI. Our project involved developing an AI chatbot, and I was particularly excited about our first meeting where we brainstormed various features and discussed technologies like LLMs and databases. Despite our enthusiasm, we struggled with a lack of clear goals, which led us to continuously add new features every week. A week before the deadline, we still hadn't completed a single feature. It was at this moment that I stood up and held a meeting. I told teammates that we should have a determined goal and we should focus on developing a feature this week.  This shift in approach allowed us to complete the project, but we only received a participation award as our single feature was not enough to advance in the competition. From this experience I gained friendship with a student in senior, and later he would introduce other seniors who have passions on AI as well. I also gained lessons of the importance of a clear goal.

Secondly, I attended a UCB course and had a wonderful experience, as I mentioned in my previous blog. I really enjoyed campus life at UCB—I visited the campus, made friends, and achieved an impressive A+ in my course. Since my goal was to use this UCB course to replace ICS 31-32 at UCI, I believe this experience was quite successful.

Thirdly, I took the GRE for the first time and scored 334 with a 3 on the writing section. I was really pleased with the result, especially since it was my first attempt. I expanded my vocabulary significantly during the preparation for GRE, which helped me in Writing 60. I was able to use euphuism to enhance my writing, ultimately earning an A in that course—something I never thought was possible!
